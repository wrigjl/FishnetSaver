# FishnetSaver
Windows Screensaver for running lichess fishnet analysis while idle

This is the start of a screensaver module for windows that runs the
fishnet client while the screen is blank.

Currently it requires two registry keys to be in place to
make this work (see #1). It also requires that you've gotten
an API key and the client .exe is installed somewhere.
